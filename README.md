# catapult-software
A place to store all code needed for the EIC catapult project.
All the hardware used in this project was acquired from:

https://www.amazon.ca/Elegoo-Project-Starter-Tutorial-Arduino/dp/B01D8KOZF4/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=elegoo+uno&qid=1622936663&sr=8-5

For stepper_motor.ino:

    -Moves the stepper motor around one revolution every 5 seconds.
    -Setup based on the diagram at https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/debanshudas23/getting-started-with-stepper-motor-28byj-48-3de8c9

For ultrasonic_sensor.ino:

    -Uses the display to show the distance of the nearest object to the ultransonic sensor.
    -The sensor has a maximum range of 4.50m, anything greater than that and it can not accurately calculate the distance.
    -To see a setup of the electronics, see the image labelled "ultrasonic-sensor-image.jpg." I am working on getting a proper diagram drawn up.
